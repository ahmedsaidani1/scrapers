FULL SHOPIFY AUTOMATION - FINAL SETUP
================================================================================

You have Shopify staff access! Now we can automate EVERYTHING.

STEP 1: TEST THE UPLOAD NOW
================================================================================

Run this command with YOUR email and password:

python auto_shopify_upload.py your.email@example.com yourpassword

This will:
- Open Chrome browser
- Login to Shopify with your credentials
- Upload all CSV files from shopify_imports/
- Close browser

Watch it work to make sure everything is correct!


STEP 2: CREATE WEEKLY AUTOMATION TASK
================================================================================

Once the test works, run this command as Administrator:

schtasks /create /tn "Weekly_Shopify_Upload" /tr "python C:\Users\ahmed\Desktop\scrapers\auto_shopify_upload.py your.email@example.com yourpassword" /sc weekly /d SUN /st 05:00 /f

Change:
- your.email@example.com → Your actual email
- yourpassword → Your actual password


STEP 3: VERIFY AUTOMATION
================================================================================

Check both tasks are created:

schtasks /query /tn "Weekly_Shopify_CSV_Export"
schtasks /query /tn "Weekly_Shopify_Upload"


COMPLETE WEEKLY FLOW (100% AUTOMATED):
================================================================================

Sunday 2:00 AM → Scrapers run (31,488 products collected)
Sunday 4:00 AM → CSV files generated (with 20% markup)
Sunday 5:00 AM → CSV files uploaded to Shopify automatically
                 ↓
                 Products in Shopify as drafts
                 ↓
                 Client reviews and publishes


MANUAL TESTING:
================================================================================

Test CSV generation:
python shopify_csv_export.py 20

Test Shopify upload:
python auto_shopify_upload.py your.email@example.com yourpassword

Run both together:
python shopify_csv_export.py 20
python auto_shopify_upload.py your.email@example.com yourpassword


SECURITY NOTE:
================================================================================

Your password will be stored in the Windows Task Scheduler.
Only you (and administrators) can see it.

For better security, you can:
1. Create a separate Shopify staff account just for automation
2. Give it only "Product" permissions
3. Use that account's credentials


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================================================================================

If upload fails:
- Make sure Chrome browser is installed
- Check your Shopify email/password are correct
- Try running manually first to see errors
- Check logs in the console output


WHAT'S AUTOMATED NOW:
================================================================================

✓ Scraping (Sunday 2 AM)
✓ CSV export (Sunday 4 AM)
✓ Shopify upload (Sunday 5 AM)
✓ 100% HANDS-FREE!
